# tatakAI

A video game that seeks to use  Reinforcement Learning to train NPCs to fight. Used the Unity Game Engine
along with Unity ML Agents.

I was team lead for this project. Coordinated between the game development and the machine learning
teams (total of 8-10 developers). Envisioned project scope and direction.

Created as part of a collaboration between ACM AI and ACM Game Studio at UCLA (student organizations on campus).

Code is in Assets, under different subdirectories depending on 
who added that code.
